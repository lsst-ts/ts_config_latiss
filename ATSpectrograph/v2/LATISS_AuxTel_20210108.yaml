# Ticket used to create this file: DM-28274
# Date created: 2021-01-08
# Description: Grating and filter offset values based on measurements taken on 2020-03-16.
# Seeing was very dynamic so expect these values to have errors, exercise will need repeating.
# Grating offsets assume focusing at filter central wavelengths
# This new file adds pointing offsets for the grating(s) and filters (although they're zero).
