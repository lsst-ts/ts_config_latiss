# Ticket used to create this file: DM-28424
# Date created: 2021-01-20
# Description: Update BG40 and RG610, plus Grating focus offset values based on measurements taken
#  on 2020-01-20.
# quadnotch1 was also measured. Unsure why no offset is required.
# Grating offsets assume focusing at filter central wavelengths
# Grating offset measured only for ronchi90lpmm, the offset may differ for the 170lpmm
