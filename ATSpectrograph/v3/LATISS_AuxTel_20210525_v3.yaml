# Ticket used to create this file: DM-29217
# Date created: 2021-05-25
# Description: Filter offset values based on measurements taken on 2021-01-08
# Grating offsets assume focusing at filter central wavelengths
# This new file includes grating pointing offsets measured on 2021-03-11
# Re-did grating focus offsets based on 2021-05-25 datasets
# The focus offset for ronchi90lpmm is unchanged.
# WARNING: grating and filter names must registered with DM to be properly ingested.
# NOTE (2021-07-07) - these offsets were determined with the linear stage at the home
# position (0mm) by accident, not at the extreme (67mm)
