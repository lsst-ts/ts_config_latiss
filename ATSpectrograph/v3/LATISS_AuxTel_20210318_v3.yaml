# Ticket used to create this file: DM-29350
# Date created: 2021-03-23
# Description: Filter offset values based on measurements taken on 2021-01-08
# Grating offsets assume focusing at filter central wavelengths
# This new file includes grating pointing offsets measured on 2021-03-11
# It also includes grating focus offsets for the ronchi170lpmm and holo4_003
# measured on 2021-03-11.
# Sign is now switched from previous file for hologram and ronchi170lpmm.
# The focus offset for ronchi90lpmm is unchanged.
# WARNING: grating and filter names must registered with DM to be properly ingested.
