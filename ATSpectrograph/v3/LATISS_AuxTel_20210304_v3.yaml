# Ticket used to create this file: DM-28854
# Date created: 2021-03-04
# Description: Previous run did not use updated focus offsets, but did use proper
# pointing offsets. This config uses BG40, RG610, quadnotch, and grating focus offsets from
# measurements taken on 2021-01-20.
# Unsure why no offset is required for quadnotch.
# Grating offsets assume focusing at filter central wavelengths, but were approximated from
# a non-wavelength calibrated spectrum.
# Grating offset measured only for ronchi90lpmm, the offset may differ for the 170lpmm
# pointing offsets remain the same as 2021-02-15 when the sign was flipped.
