# Ticket used to create this file: DM-30950
# Date created: 2021-07-07
# Description: Filter offset values based on measurements taken on 2021-01-08
# Grating offsets assume focusing at filter central wavelengths
# This new file includes grating pointing offsets measured on 2021-07-07
# grating stage at position of 67mm
# Linear stage ranges modified to avoid limits. This is to prevent timeouts
# from the API in stage movements.
# WARNING: grating and filter names must registered with DM to be properly ingested.
