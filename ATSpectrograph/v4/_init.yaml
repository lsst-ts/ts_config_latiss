# Ticket used to create this file: DM-33575
# Date created: 2022-02-04
# Description: Installed two new filters, focus offsets were determined and found to be within ~2um of original estimate.
#              Leaving the values unchanged for the SDSSi and SDSSi filters, and same as the SDSSg.
#              The estimate for the SDSSg was remeasured and found to be consistent.
# changed host to use dns name
# WARNING: grating and filter names must registered with DM to be properly ingested.
